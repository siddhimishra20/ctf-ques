        <h1>Welcome to the CTF Challenge!</h1> <!-- [[The beginning of your journey starts here, but it’s not where the real answer lies.]] -->
        <p>The Doctor is at play again. His movements are elusive, his plans obscure.</p> 
            <p>But one thing is certain: he's hiding something valuable. A powerful artifact. A key to something greater.</p>
        <p>Where could he have hidden it? The answer is buried deep within the shadows of GDG.</p> <!--{ Keep looking, the answer isn't in plain text, but a reflection.} -->
           <p>Follow the trail of clues, and you'll be one step closer to uncovering the truth.</p> <!--++ But don’t assume the first answer is the correct one. It could be a distraction.+- --></p>
        <p>HINT: Check out GDG's pinned Instagram posts. What secrets lie within?</p> <!-- Throughout heaven and earth, I alone am the honoured 1/atbash-->
